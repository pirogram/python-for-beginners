question: |
  The program would ask the user to select rock, paper or scissor. Once the user has made a selection, the program would also randomly select one of the three. It would then tell the user who won. The program would keep the score and keep playing the game as long as user wishes to play.

  Here is how the game starts:
  ```
  Let's begin playing...

  Current Score: Me - 0, You - 0, Draw - 0
  Choose (R)ock, (P)aper or (S)cissor (R/P/S):
  ```

  This is how the interaction looks over a few challenges:
