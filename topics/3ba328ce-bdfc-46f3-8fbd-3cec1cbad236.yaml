  Control statements govern the flow of code in a program. This minibook has a lot of exercises to master the control statements in Python. If you have just started learning to program, you should work through all the problems. However, if you already know programming and you are just trying to master the Python language, you can be selective about the problems you solve.

  This minibook would cover the problems related to:
  * `if`, `elif`, `else` etc.
  * `while` loops
  * `break`
  * Nesting the control statements.

  The `for` loop is left out of scope and would be covered separately with `list` related problems.
