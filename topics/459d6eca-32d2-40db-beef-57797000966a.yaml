  If you have a list of strings that you would like to join, a more efficient way is to use `join` method.

  Ask the user to enter a list of comma separated numbers. Convert it into a comma separated string of `even`, `odd`. For example, if the user entered `'1, 2, 3, 4'`, your program should convert it to `'odd, even, odd, even'`.

question: |
  Ask the user to enter a sentence. Print the sentence back after removing unnecessary whitespace characters. For example, if the user enters `There   was a   lazy    dog.`, your program should print `There was a lazy dog.`

  Hint: Split the sentence into a list of words. These words would have multiple blank characters (`''`). Create another list without these characters and join it back.
