  Let's say, we want to write a small program. It would ask the user to enter two numbers and it would print the sum of those numbers. So, if the user entered numbers `4` and `2`, the program would print `The sum of 4 and 2 is 6.` Let's see how we can approach it.

  number1 = input("Please enter a number: ")

  print('The sum of', number1, 'and', number2, 'is', number1 + number2, '.')

  If you enter `4` and `2`, the program would print `42` instead of `6`. What's the problem? Well, if you remember, the `input()` function yields the value of type `str`. So, it yields strings `'4'` and `'2'` respectively instead of integers `4` and `2`. This is where type conversion comes into the picture. You can convert the string `'4'` to integer `4` by using the function `int('4')`.

  Here is a corrected program:
