  List is the most common way to organize information. If you open your email application, what you see is the list of emails. Windows Explorer or Mac Finder show you a lists of files and folders. All applications have a list of menu items (that can have nested list of items). Lists are so universal, that they keep popping up in all software applications all the time.

  All programming languages have strong support for working with lists and Python is no exception. In fact, Python has one of the most feature-packed implementation for lists.

  In this chapter, we'll talk about:
  * organizing values in a list
  * slicing and dicing the list in various ways
  * moving values around within a list
  * modifying a list to add or remove entries

  And of course, we'll solve a variety of problems related to lists.
