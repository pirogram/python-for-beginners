question: |
  Ask the user to enter a number. Print the count of digits in that number. For example, if the user enters `342`, the program would print `3` since it has three digits.

  Hint: Take the number and keep dividing it by 10 till you are left with 0. For example, `342 // 10` gives you `34`; `34 // 10` gives you `3`; `3 // 10` gives you `0`.
