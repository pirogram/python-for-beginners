  Write the tic-tac-toe program where two players take turn. Here is a sample interaction:
  ```
  |1|2|3|
  |4|5|6|
  |7|8|9|

  Choose the position for X: 5
  ---
  |1|2|3|
  |4|X|6|
  |7|8|9|

  Choose the position for O: 1
  ---
  |O|2|3|
  |4|X|6|
  |7|8|9|

  Choose the position for X: 7
  ---
  |O|2|3|
  |4|X|6|
  |X|8|9|

  Choose the position for O:
  ```

  You must check for these conditions:
  * When a user selects a position, it should really be free.
  * Game is over if no more positions left on the board.
  * Game is over when if a player has won.

  Get the basic game running and then add checks for all these conditions. Good luck!
