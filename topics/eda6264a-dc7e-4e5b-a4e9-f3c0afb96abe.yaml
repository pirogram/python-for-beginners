  `list` is a foundational data structure in Python. In fact, in all programming languages, `list` and its variants find heavy usage in all sorts of problems. The `list` problems in this package are divided in the following topics:
  * Find out something about the list. For example, 2nd largest number.
  * Find out if the list follows a pattern. For example, arithmetic progression.
  * Find pairs of items in the list based on some criteria. For example, find +ve and -ve pairs.
  * Various list creation situations. For example, flatten a nested list.
  * Moving the list elements around. For example, reversing the order of elements in a list.

  Many of these problems are _hard_. So, take your time and don't get discouraged if you struggle with them. Just ask for help.
