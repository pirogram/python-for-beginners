  While dealing with lists, it's very common to check if a given item is in the list or not. For example, if you make a list of all the fruits that your friend likes, from time to time, you would want to find out if a given fruit is in that list or not.

  This is where we introduce two more conditional operators: `in` and `not in`. Let's look at a few examples of these operators.

  favorites = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'pineapple']

  print('mango' not in favorites)

  Given that `in` and `not in` are conditional operators (i.e. they yield `True` or `False`), you can use them in `if/else` statements.
