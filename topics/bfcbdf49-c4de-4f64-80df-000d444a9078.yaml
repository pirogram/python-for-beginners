  Strings are like ordered list of characters. Hence, they support indexing, slicing and many other operations that are supported by `list`.

  Strings are immutable like `tuple`. Once created, a string cannot be modified. If you want to transform a string, you must create a new string.

question: |
  Given a string, find out the number of unique letters in that string. (Hint: use can use `set()`). For example, `ram sharma` has `6` unique letters (including space).
code: |
  s = 'lord of the rings is a good movie.'
