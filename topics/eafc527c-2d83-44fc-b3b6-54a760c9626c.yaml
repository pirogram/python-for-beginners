  Let's get more practice on the `while` loop. In order to do that, we'll solve a lot of _star pattern_ problems. For these exercises, it would be handy to remember that multiplying a string by a number makes that string repeat. For example, `5*'#'` would result in `'#####'`.

question: |
  Ask the user to enter a number. Print square star pattern with that many columns and rows. For example:
  ```
  Enter a number: 5
  *****
  *****
  *****
  *****
  *****
  ```

  As you would notice, the star pattern has `5` columns and `5` rows.
