question: |
  Write a small application to keep track of Todo items. The user can view the current list of todo items and add more. Here is how the interaction looks when you start the application.
  ```
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================
  There are no todos yet. Add one to get started.

  Add a Todo:
  ```

  And this is how it proceeds:
  ```
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================
  There are no todos yet. Add one to get started.

  Add a Todo: Go to Moon
  ---
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================
  1. Go to Moon

  Add a Todo: Shoot a star
  ---
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================
  1. Go to Moon
  2. Shoot a star

  Add a Todo:

  Update the todo list program to enable deletion of Todo items. Here is how the interaction looks now:
  ```
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================

  ---
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================
  1. Go to Moon

  Do you want to (A)dd a Todo or (D)elete a Todo (A/D)? A
  Enter a Todo: Shoot a star
  ---
  Current List of Todos:

  Now, we'll also allow the user to mark a Todo as `done`. Here is how the interaction looks:
  ```
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================
  There are no todos yet. Add one to get started.

  Add a Todo: Go to Moon
  ---
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================
  1. Go to Moon

  (A)dd (D)elete or (M)ark as done (A/D/M)? A
  Enter a Todo: Shoot a star
  ---
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================
  1. Go to Moon
  2. Shoot a star

  (A)dd (D)elete or (M)ark as done (A/D/M)? M
  Which one to mark as done (number please)? 1
  ---
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================
  1. [Done] Go to Moon
  2. Shoot a star

  (A)dd (D)elete or (M)ark as done (A/D/M)? D
  Which one to delete (number please)? 2
  ---
  Current List of Todos:
  ======================
  1. [Done] Go to Moon

  (A)dd (D)elete or (M)ark as done (A/D/M)?
  ```
