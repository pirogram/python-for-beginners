code: |
  s = 'A lazy dog was sleeping. A quick fox was jumping. And the sun was shining.'

  # How to find out the number of sentences in this string?
  # By splitting on '. '
  sentences = s.split('. ')
  print('Sentences ->', sentences)

  print('No of sentences ->', len(sentences))

  Given a multiline string, print the number of words in each line. For example, the output for the string in code section should be:
  ```
  line 1 - 2 words
  line 2 - 3 words
  line 3 - 2 words
  ```

  Note: you can split the string on `\n` to separate out the lines.
code: |
  s = '''old pond
  frog leaps in
  water's sound'''

  Given a string, find out the count of number based words. For example, the string `'1984 was hotter than 1985'` has two number based words (1984 & 1985). You can use `.isdecimal()` method.
code: |
  s = 'Year 1984 was hotter than 1985 which itself was hotter than 1986'
