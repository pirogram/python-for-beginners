  Here is the problem we want to solve: we'll keep asking the user to enter a number till the user enters `0`. We'll then print the total number of times the user entered a number.

  One way to structure this program (based on our current knowledge) is as follows:
---
type: live-code
id: 7ae6b8e6-54a2-40b3-997f-125d7a7a866c
code: |
  count = 0
  num = int( input('Enter a number: '))

  while num != 0:
    count += 1
    num = int( input('Enter a number: '))

  print('You entered', count, 'numbers')
--- |
  This program works! However, can we rewrite it to avoid these two separate calls to `input` function? Yes we can, here is the example:
---
type: live-code
id: 2a8b606f-2485-4ecd-8d81-837812c3fb7e
code: |
  count = 0
  while True:
    num =  int(input("Please enter a number: "))
    if num == 0:
      break

    count = count + 1

  print("You entered", count, "numbers")

--- |
  In this program, `while True` is called the infinite loop because `while` loop is checking on a condition that is always true. The key in this program is the `break` statement.

  What does `break` do? Whenever Python encounters a `break` statement, it would exit the while loop and jump the next statement _after_ the loop.

  The objective of this program is to get user to enter an even number. Keep asking the user to enter an even number as long as the user enters only odd number. When the user enters an even number, print `good job`. Example:

  ```
  Even number please: 3
  Even number please: 5
  Even number please: 4
  Good Job!
  ```

  Keep asking the user to enter a number as long as the user enters an even number. As soon as the user enters an odd number, print the total number of times an even number was entered. For example:

  ```
  A number please: 4
  A number please: 2
  A number please: 3
  You entered 2 even numbers.
  ```

  Keep asking the user to enter a number till the user enters `0`. Print the sum of all the numbers that user entered. For example:

  ```
  A number please: 4
  A number please: 2
  A number please: 3
  A number please: 0
  Sum of numbers you entered: 9
  ```

  Keep asking the user to enter a number till the user enters `0`. Print the average of all the numbers that the user entered. For example:

  ```
  A number please: 4
  A number please: 2
  A number please: 3
  A number please: 0
  Average of numbers you entered: 3
  ```

  Hint: To calculate average, you should keep track of sum and count of numbers that user entered.

  Keep asking the user to enter a number till the user enters `0`. Print the largest number entered by the user. If the user entered `0` as the first number, print `what what? what what?`.

  Generate a random number between 1 & 20 and ask the user to guess it. If the guess is smaller than the random number, print `go higher`. If the guess is bigger than the random number, print `go lower`. Keep doing this till the user makes correct guess. If the guess is correct, print `Good Job!`.

  The following code can be used to generate random number between 1 and 20:

  ```
  import random
  random_number = random.randint(1, 20)
  ```
code: |
  import random
  random_number = random.randint(1, 20)
