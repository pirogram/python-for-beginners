  Using a neat trick, we can combine the _sequence of numbers_ using `range()` and list traversal. Here is a quick example:

---
type: live-code
id: b76ae2e8-7fd1-4fed-af77-90cec22b4a29
code: |
  numbers = [7,   0, -18,   0,  16, -18,   8,  -4,  10, -18,  -9,  -9,  -2,
       2,  -2,  17, -20,  -5,  14, -16]

  for index in range( len(numbers) ):
      print(index, '->', numbers[index])
--- |
  The function `range( len(numbers) )` gives us a sequence of numbers starting from `0` to one less than the length of list. By using this sequence of numbers as the index, we can traverse the list.

  We could have done the same using good old `while` as well:

code: |
  numbers = [7,   0, -18,   0,  16, -18,   8,  -4,  10, -18,  -9,  -9,  -2,
         2,  -2,  17, -20,  -5,  14, -16]

  index = 0
  while index < len(numbers):
      print(index, '->', numbers[index])
      index += 1

  print(numbers)

  Both these examples have the same effect. Using `range()` function, we get a more compact expression.

  You are given a list of numbers. Print the numbers from index 3 to index 7.
code: |
  numbers = [7,   0, -18,   0,  16, -18,   8,  -4,  10, -18,  -9,  -9,  -2,
       2,  -2,  17, -20,  -5,  14, -16]

question: |
  Print a list of items in reverse order. You would need to start from last index and go all the way to index 0.

code: |
  fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'peach', 'pineapple', 'kiwi']

question: |
  You are given a list of numbers. Write a program to reverse the order of numbers within the list. For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4]` should become `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.

  Hint: we need to work with swapping the numbers at first and last index, second and second last index, so on so forth. How to swap the positions of two items in a list? Here is an example:
  ```python
  list[some_index], list[another_index] = list[another_index], list[some_index]
  ```
code: |
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
